MCTL is a python tool for automating and reducing the operational cost
of running Minecraft servers. MCTL provides a number of features:

* Management (starting and stopping) of one or more servers.
* Plugin management (building, updating, and snapshotting).
* Fake server when the main server is offline, showing a status message.
* All of this wrapped up in an easy to use CLI.
